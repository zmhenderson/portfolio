## Projects

### Mapping Epidemic Spread with Transportation-Based SEIR Models
Developed a network-based compartmental model using ordinary differential equations to account for the effects of transportation on disease spread. 
COVID-19 data processing, parameter estimation, and simulations were conducted using **Python**. This model allows for the prediction of disease spread through
both the spatial and temporal dimension.

### IBM Data Science Capstone
[Data Science Capstone Repository](https://github.com/zmhenderson/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone)

Utilized **Data Analysis** and **Machine Learning** methods to determined which Space-X Falcon 9 first-stage rockets will land successfully to support the efforts of a hypothetical competitor. Methods involved exploratory data analysis, creating interactive maps with **Folium**, and training machine learning models to properly classify the success or failure of rocket launches.
